# make_24
A small gadget to play the game of make24.
Given 4 integers, with basic arithmetic operations alone (add, subtract, multiply, divide), compute 24.


## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/paul0403/make_24.git`
`python3 example.py`

Tweak the numbers to your liking.

Of course, you can also use the package in your own python scripts:
```python
import make24
```

This project is not currently on PyPI, so git cloning from source is the only way to use it.
